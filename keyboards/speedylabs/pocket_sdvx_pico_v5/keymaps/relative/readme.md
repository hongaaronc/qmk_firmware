# Gamepad Speedy Labs Pocket SDVX Pico V5 Layout

This keymap for the Pocket SDVX Pico V5 emulates gamepad controls with relative axis inputs. The encoder-controlled-joysticks, rather than looping around for absolute input, are constrained at the minimum and maximum joystick values and return to center when not being rotated, for relative input.

The keys are mapped with games in mind that use this type of input, such as [Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/Hatsune_Miku_Project_DIVA_Mega_Mix/).
